# Rezajv95-Berth-allocation-with-time-dependent-physical-limitations-on-vessels

The problem that is modeled in this section is related to an article published in EJOR, which has been worked in the field of ship-to-berth allocation. The model of this problem was interesting to me because it was similar to VRP problems and scheduling models. The article related to this model can be accessed in the files section.
The model of this article is written in GAMS and Python environment.
